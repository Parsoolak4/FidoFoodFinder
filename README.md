Here's a well-organized README.md for Fido's Food Quest:
markdownCopy# 🐕 Fido's Food Quest
[![Clojure](https://img.shields.io/badge/Clojure-%23Clojure.svg?style=flat&logo=Clojure&logoColor=white)](https://clojure.org/)

A Clojure-based pathfinding adventure where you help Fido navigate through mazes to find food. This program demonstrates breadth-first search algorithms through an interactive maze-solving visualization.

## 🎮 Features
### Core Functionality
- Interactive menu-driven interface
- Custom maze map support via text files
- Real-time pathfinding visualization
- Built-in map file browser

### Visualization Elements
The game uses simple ASCII characters to represent different elements:
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `@` | Food (Goal) |
| `#` | Wall |
| `-` | Open Path |
| `+` | Solution Path |
| `!` | Explored Areas |

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Clojure installed on your system
- Text editor for custom maps

### Running the Program
```bash
clj -M fido.clj
🗺️ Map Creation
Format Example
Copy-#--#
--#-@
#----
Map Guidelines

Maps must be rectangular
Use only supported symbols
Ensure at least one valid path exists
Include exactly one food (@) position

🛠️ Technical Architecture
Core Components

Pathfinding Engine: Implements breadth-first search
Visualization Module: Handles real-time display
Map Parser: Processes custom map files
Menu System: Manages user interaction

Technical Highlights

Written in pure Clojure
Functional programming paradigm
Zero external dependencies
Modular code structure

🧪 Algorithm Details
The pathfinding system uses breadth-first search (BFS) to:

Find the optimal (shortest) path
Explore all possible routes
Visualize the search process
Track visited locations
